# Datastore.js

**A lightweight in-memory key-value database for javascript.**

It is built on top of plain JavaScript objects as they can store any type of data in key value pairs. They can have nested objects and arrays as a value. The logic is fairly simple: every datastore instance initializes a new object and all the CRUD operations are performed on it.
